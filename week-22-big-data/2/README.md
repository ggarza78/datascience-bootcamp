# 22.2 Big Data in the Cloud

## Overview

Today's class will continue to build on PySpark DataFrames using Google Colab. The goal today is to demonstrate how natural language processing (NLP) works by creating a big data processing pipeline that is used to train a Naive Bayes spam detector.

## Class Objectives

By the end of today's class, students will be able to:

* Explain why NLP is necessary for a big data tool kit.
* Apply transformations resulting from NLP data processing to PySpark DataFrames.
* Explain and utilize PySpark text-processing methods like tokenization, stop words, and term and document frequency.
* Describe example steps in an NLP data processing pipeline.
